# React Microfrontend & Webpack 5 Module Federation i18n Setup

## Description

This is a simple POC repo for setting up a "main" React 17 app (`react-main-container`) which consumes a React 17 microfrontend (`react-mfe`) using Webpack 5 module federation. The main purpose of this POC is to investigate internationalization (`react-i18next`) with this type of setup - and whether it is possible to colocate apps and their relevant translations (i.e. MFE owns its relevant translations).

For solving this, one approach can be where the `react-i18next` instance is initialized in the main React 17 application and then passed down to the React 17 MFE. The MFE will then dynamically add its own translations to this existing i18n instance. Effectively, they have a "shared" i18 instance.

Alternatively, we may prefer having more independent MFEs where they manage their own i18n instance setup. Although it will no longer (out of the box) sync language changes from the main app and config, we now have boundaries between different apps and can avoid problems with having a "global" i18n instance (mutations and conflicts). See PR for example where i18n instances are decoupled between main app and MFE: https://github.com/giavinh79/react-microfrontend-internationalization/pull/2

## Running

1. Run the microfrontend (runs on `localhost:5000`)

- `cd react-mfe`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- Since `react-mfe` leverages the `i18n` instance from `react-main-container`, it cannot run independently. Solving this is not within the scope of this POC.

2. Run the main app (runs on `localhost:4000`)

- cd `react-main-container`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

3. Go to `localhost:4000` & click on the button to toggle between English & French locales.

## Overview

1. The main application, `react-main-container`, defines in `webpack.config.js` microfrontends it will consume.
2. The MFE, `react-mfe`, exposes `Microfrontend.tsx` in `webpack.config.js` so that it can be imported by `react-main-container`.
3. `react-main-container` initializes two namespaces: `common` and `app`
4. `react-mfe` initializes one namespace: `app`

## Results

1. MFE _CAN_ access namespaces from main application
2. MFE _IS_ able to add its namespace to the main i18n instance. It uses `addResourceBundle` which executes synchronously.

## Typescript Integration

In order to typically (integrate TypeScript)[https://react.i18next.com/latest/typescript] for `react-i18next` internationalization projects, a `i18next.d.ts` file is added which imports project locale files for type safety and augmented intellisense. Now, when using the `t` translate function, you'll get errors on invalid keys & see available keys! One caveat though, is when using the `useTranslation` hook you must pass in the namespaces being used otherwise the types will not work as expected.

This works fine for typical monolithic frontend applications however, in an architecture where an app consumes multiple i18n instances, TypeScript is a lot more difficult to configure. Based on comments in the repo, there does not appear to be official support for this type of situation - `www.github.com/i18next/react-i18next/issues/726#issuecomment-1499882853`. 

As mentioned above although typescript integration is straightforward in the host app since there is only one `i18n` instance, the MFE app accesses both its own translations and the host app ones. When configuring typescript for the MFE i18n instance with `i18next.d.ts`, due to its global namespace, it also affects types for the host app instance (and when we import certain APIs like the `Trans` component, it'll automatically use types generated by the MFE `i18next.d.ts` making it difficult to use for host app translations). I can *make it work* by typing the host app instance with an overridden `t` field (i.e. typed as any) so it won't error when using host translation keys but you do lose intellisense. Alternatively, using types like `TFunction` gives it more intellisense but also makes it more annoying to work with for the `Trans` component.

Since the goal of this POC is to also assume that MFEs are in their own repo, it's difficult to enable full type safety for host app translations (i.e. if it was a monorepo for example, it could have access to directly import those types). There are some tools/approaches like https://github.com/module-federation/universe/tree/main/packages/typescript, npm packages, https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/07/19/typescript-federated-modules/ but based on how TypeScript works with `i18-next` (where you augment types using a `.d.ts` file) I don't see how they could work. It may be worth foregoing typescript integration for microfrontends to avoid running into these edge cases and annoyances with typing host app translations. In the past, I've used `react-i18next` without their recent TypeScript integration functionality and it works fine because in a typical workflow, you will typically add a key-value to the locale file and just paste the key wherever you need it. Additionally, through QA, tests, and certain extensions like `i18n Ally` typos can be easily discovered.
