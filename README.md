# React Microfrontend & Webpack 5 Module Federation i18n Setup

## Description

This is a simple POC repo for setting up a "main" React 17 app (`react-main-container`) which consumes a React 17 microfrontend (`react-mfe`) using Webpack 5 module federation. The main purpose of this POC is to investigate internationalization (`react-i18next`) with this type of setup - and whether it is possible to colocate apps and their relevant translations (i.e. MFE owns its relevant translations).

For solving this, one approach can be where the `react-i18next` instance is initialized in the main React 17 application and then passed down to the React 17 MFE. The MFE will then dynamically add its own translations to this existing i18n instance. Effectively, they have a "shared" i18 instance.

Alternatively, we may prefer having more independent MFEs where they manage their own i18n instance setup. Although it will no longer (out of the box) sync language changes from the main app and config, we now have boundaries between different apps and can avoid problems with having a "global" i18n instance (mutations and conflicts). See PR for example where i18n instances are decoupled between main app and MFE: https://github.com/giavinh79/react-microfrontend-internationalization/pull/2

## Running

1. Run the microfrontend (runs on `localhost:5000`)

- `cd react-mfe`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- Since `react-mfe` leverages the `i18n` instance from `react-main-container`, it cannot run independently. Solving this is not within the scope of this POC.

2. Run the main app (runs on `localhost:4000`)

- cd `react-main-container`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

3. Go to `localhost:4000` & click on the button to toggle between English & French locales.

## Overview

1. The main application, `react-main-container`, defines in `webpack.config.js` microfrontends it will consume.
2. The MFE, `react-mfe`, exposes `Microfrontend.tsx` in `webpack.config.js` so that it can be imported by `react-main-container`.
3. `react-main-container` initializes two namespaces: `common` and `app`
4. `react-mfe` initializes one namespace: `app`

## Results

1. MFE _CAN_ access namespaces from main application
2. MFE _IS_ able to add its namespace to the main i18n instance. It uses `addResourceBundle` which executes synchronously.

## Typescript Integration

To add intellisense for internationalization, we can add a `i18next.d.ts` namespace that uses our locale files to add type safety to the `t` function.

However, in a MFE architecture with separate i18n instances, TypeScript is a lot more difficult to configure.
Based on comments in the repo, there does not appear to be official support for this type of situation -
`www.github.com/i18next/react-i18next/issues/726#issuecomment-1499882853`

For example, there is no real way to enable full type safety when you are using translations from the host within the MFE unless it has access to that package somehow (i.e. maybe a `npm package`, maybe we have a monorepo set up where we can directly import it...etc.). For the sake of this POC, we will assume MFEs may exist within their own repo so it's more limiting. It may be worth investigating tools like https://github.com/module-federation/universe/tree/main/packages/typescript or other approaches like in https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/07/19/typescript-federated-modules/ but based on initial reading, they don't seem like reliable solutions to the problem above.
