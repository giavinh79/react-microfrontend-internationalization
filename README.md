# React Microfrontend & Webpack 5 Module Federation i18n Setup

## Description

This is a simple POC repo for setting up a "main" React 17 app (`react-main-container`) which consumes a React 17 microfrontend (`react-mfe`) using Webpack 5 module federation. The main purpose of this POC is to investigate internationalization (`react-i18next`) with this type of setup - and whether it is possible to colocate apps and their relevant translations (i.e. MFE owns its relevant translations).

For solving this, one approach can be where the `react-i18next` instance is initialized in the main React 17 application and then passed down to the React 17 MFE. The MFE will then dynamically add its own translations to this existing i18n instance. Effectively, they have a "shared" i18 instance.

Alternatively, we may prefer having more independent MFEs where they manage their own i18n instance setup. Although it will no longer (out of the box) sync language changes from the main app and config, we now have boundaries between different apps and can avoid problems with having a "global" i18n instance (mutations and conflicts). See PR for example where i18n instances are decoupled between main app and MFE: https://github.com/giavinh79/react-microfrontend-internationalization/pull/2

## Running

1. Run the microfrontend (runs on `localhost:5000`)

- `cd react-mfe`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`
- Since `react-mfe` leverages the `i18n` instance from `react-main-container`, it cannot run independently. Solving this is not within the scope of this POC.

2. Run the main app (runs on `localhost:4000`)

- cd `react-main-container`
- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

3. Go to `localhost:4000` & click on the button to toggle between English & French locales.

## Overview

1. The main application, `react-main-container`, defines in `webpack.config.js` microfrontends it will consume.
2. The MFE, `react-mfe`, exposes `Microfrontend.tsx` in `webpack.config.js` so that it can be imported by `react-main-container`.
3. `react-main-container` initializes two namespaces: `common` and `app`
4. `react-mfe` initializes one namespace: `app`

## Results

1. MFE _CAN_ access namespaces from main application
2. MFE _IS_ able to add its namespace to the main i18n instance. It uses `addResourceBundle` which executes synchronously.

## Typescript Integration

In order to typically (integrate TypeScript)[https://react.i18next.com/latest/typescript] for `react-i18next` internationalization projects, a `i18next.d.ts` file is added which imports project locale files for type safety and augmented intellisense. Now, when using the `t` translate function, you'll get errors on invalid keys & see available keys! One caveat though, is when using the `useTranslation` hook you must pass in the namespaces being used otherwise the types will not work as expected.

This works fine for typical monolithic frontend applications however, in an architecture where an app consumes multiple i18n instances, TypeScript is a lot more difficult to configure. Based on comments in the repo, there does not appear to be official support for this type of situation - `www.github.com/i18next/react-i18next/issues/726#issuecomment-1499882853`.

As mentioned above although typescript integration is straightforward in the host app since there is only one `i18n` instance, the MFE app accesses both its own translations and the host app ones. When configuring typescript for the MFE i18n instance with `i18next.d.ts`, due to its global namespace, it also affects types for the host app instance (and when we import certain APIs like the `Trans` component, it'll automatically use types generated by the MFE `i18next.d.ts` making it difficult to use for host app translations). I can _make it work_ by typing the host app instance with an overridden `t` field (i.e. typed as any) so it won't error when using host translation keys but you do lose intellisense. Alternatively, using types like `TFunction` gives it more intellisense but also makes it more annoying to work with for the `Trans` component - overall it's very hacky playing with the types like this.

Since the goal of this POC is to also assume that MFEs are in their own repo, it's difficult to enable full type safety for host app translations (i.e. if it was a monorepo for example, it could have access to directly import those types/translation files). There are some tools/approaches like https://github.com/module-federation/universe/tree/main/packages/typescript, npm packages, and https://spin.atomicobject.com/2022/07/19/typescript-federated-modules/ for sharing assets across federated modules but this does add complexity and isn't guaranteed to work due to how TypeScript works with `i18-next` (where you augment types in a single `.d.ts` file) + us using multiple i18n instances. This requires us to maybe rethink our approach of having multiple i18n instances.

Assuming we want the MFE to have access to host app translations, there are mainly two approaches. The first one assumes you want to keep separate i18n instances in which case it may be better to forego typescript integration for the microfrontend to avoid running into edge cases and annoyances with typing host app translations. In the past, I've used `react-i18next` without their TypeScript integration functionality and it works fine because in a typical workflow, you will usually just add a key-value to the locale file and paste the key wherever you need it. Additionally, through QA, tests, and certain extensions like `i18n Ally` typos or missing keys can be discovered. Alternatively, if we decide it's fine to have a single `i18n` instance, we could merge host translations into the MFE `i18n` instance and then manually type namespaces for the host translations - for simplicity it may be possible to just type the namespace so that any strings can be accepted (so it doesn't have intellisense but errors if strings aren't passed in the `t` function for example). Alternatively, since host translations get dynamically loaded into the MFE instance at run-time, the only way to have full type safety for host translations is for the MFE to have a "synced copy" of the host app locale files whether this is through an `npm package` or some process to pull in those files from the host app copy.
